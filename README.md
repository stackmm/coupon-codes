- A Coupon belongs to a Merchant
- An Invoice optionally belongs to a Coupon. An invoice may only have one coupon.
Note: When creating this new association on Invoice, your existing tests will fail unless the association is optional. Use these guides as a reference.​
- Merchants have full CRUD functionality over their coupons with criteria/restrictions defined below:
- A merchant can have a maximum of 5 activated coupons in the system at one time.
- A merchant cannot delete a coupon, rather they can activate/deactivate them.
- A Coupon has a name, unique code (e.g. “BOGO50”), and either percent-off or dollar-off value. The coupon’s code must be unique in the whole database.
- If a coupon’s dollar value (ex. “$10 off”) exceeds the total cost of that merchant’s items on the invoice, the grand total for that merchant’s items should then be $0. (In other words, the merchant will never owe money to a customer.)
- A coupon code from a Merchant only applies to Items sold by that Merchant.
